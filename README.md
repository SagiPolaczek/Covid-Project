# COVID-19 Project
### Short Description 
GUI which has two key features:
  1. 'GIVE ME GRAPHS' - Takes a city's name in Israel and returns the COVID-19 data in 3 pie charts as described later.
  2. 'Update Data' - Updating the database by scraping the official website of Ministry Of Health. 

### Motivation 
The Coronavirus is **by far** the most talked-about subject in the globe, and especially in Israel.
furthermore, the information is often dispropotionately represented, so my passion for data and solving problems produce this idea.

### Build Status
There some extra features to come:
  - [x] The data will be represented **on the GUI itselfs**.
  - [ ] The input absorption will be **more forgiving**.
  - [ ] The user will be able to plot graphs **several times in one run**.
